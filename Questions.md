(1) Which areas in California have the most to gain from ecological conservation efforts? How can conservation be prioritized?  

(2) How well do protected areas protect species? How do species fare over time and with changing climate?   

(3) How will (species distributions/ecosregions/vegetation zones/Important plant areas) be affected under future climate scenarios?  

(4) How does urban development and growth affect native species? Where is the human/ecological conflict? What ecosystems and species will be affected? To conserve biodiversity and/or native ecosystems, where should major development (eg wind farms) ideally occur?     

(5) Does protecting umbrella species (eg California gnatcatcher in Coastal Sage Scrub or Tule Elk in grasslands) protect ecosystem-associated flora and fauna? Are these species found in protected areas?    

(6) How have rare plant & their natural communities that have a very restricted range (e.g., Hesperocyparis forbesii, Pseudotsuga macrocarpa) changed over the last 20 years?   

(7) What does future land use in California look like? How will it be different from the past?
